          <h1>New ‘daylight robbery’ crime trend
          Daylight house break-ins on the rise in Empangeni, reports security company</h1>
          
          <h3>THERE has been a reported increase of thieves breaking into people’s homes through the windows in broad daylight.</h3>
          
          This was highlighted by Fidelity ADT, who said Empangeni residents must remain vigilant about security and report any suspicious activity to the relevant authorities and security companies.
          <br>
         
          
          “We have received recent reports indicating an increase in housebreakings where thieves are breaking in via windows to gain access to homes.
          
          “These incidents generally occur during the day when homeowners are at work, and suspects are targeting laptops, TVs and other valuables.
          
          “This trend has been prominent across the Empangeni area, with five incidents reported over the past week alone,” explains Anbin Govender, branch manager for Fidelity ADT Richards Bay.
          
          Fidelity ADT, together with the SAPS and local CPFs, are working to conduct regular hot spot patrols to deter crime.
          
          “Residents are urged to remain vigilant, to always arm their alarm system when leaving their homes, and to consider installing early warning systems such as outdoor beams as an additional security measure.
          
          “In addition, they are encouraged to report any suspicious activity immediately to the local SAPS or their private security company,” concluded Govender.</p>

          <h1>Department of Health makes sexual health easier for women</h1>
          <h3>The Department of Health has launched the Self-care Wellness Vending Machine to combat teenage pregnancy</h3>
<br>
OWING to the exponential increase in teenage pregnancies, the Department of Health has launched a free-of-charge service for women of childbearing age.

The healthcare department handed over an innovative solution called the Self-care Wellness Vending Machine on Wednesday in the Eastern Cape.




This is after it was recorded that more than 11 500 girls aged between 10 and 14 gave birth in public service facilities between 2020 and 2023.

Specifically targeted at sexually mature women, the vending machine will increase accessibility to sexual reproductive health and HIV prevention services, which will result in fewer unsafe abortions due to unplanned pregnancies.

Each machine is stocked with essential oral contraceptives such as Nordette, Triphasil, Microval, and Ovral, while the morning-after pill is available as an emergency contraceptive.

In addition to the various contraceptives, the Department of Health has ensured that preventative aids such as HIV self-testing kits, lubricants, pregnancy tests, sanitary towels and condoms for both males and females are also available.

A total of 13 machines are said to be rolled out to five provinces as part of the launch, followed by a countrywide roll-out later.

They will be placed in easy-to-access areas such as learning institutions, malls and at Sassa points.

            <h3>Home Affairs offices will be open for five hours a day on Saturdays</h3>
          <p >
            Ahead of the national and provincial elections on May 29, the Department of Home Affairs will extend operating hours to allow for ID collections and applications, among other services.

Offices across the country, including the King Cetshwayo District, are open for five hours a day on Saturdays until 25 May.


This will exclude the public holiday on Saturday, 27 April.

The public can collect IDs, make new applications, or obtain temporary identity certificates.

These offices will also resolve challenges of duplicates, amendments, and rectifications.

“We invite people who have applied for their IDs, particularly young people who are first-time applicants, to come to collect their documents,” said Home Affairs Deputy Minister, Njabulo Nzuza.

The department says mobile offices are also expected to deliver IDs in remote areas where applications have been made.

“Local offices, working with stakeholders that include councillors, will communicate the dates, times and venues of those visits,” said Nzuza.

            <h2>Richards Bay CIT guard in custody for theft of cash <br>
              Cash-in-transit guard to appear in court in Richards Bay over theft of money</h2>
            <p>A local cash-in-transit (CIT) guard was on Monday arrested by Hawks members from the Richards Bay Serious Organised Crime unit for theft.

              Reports reveal that on Thursday, the suspect (33) collected R209 500 from one of the company’s clients in Ulundi and failed to hand over the money to the cash volt.
              
              
              When the client enquired about the collected money, an internal investigation was conducted.
              
              Hawks spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Simphiwe Mhlongo said a preliminary investigation revealed that the receipt book had been tampered with, and a case of theft was reported at Richards Bay Police Station.
              
              “The case docket was handed over to the Hawks for investigation and a suspect was identified. A search warrant was obtained and executed on Monday. During the search in the suspect’s residence, R26 000 was found.
              
              “He was placed under arrest and charged accordingly. He is expected to appear in the Richards Bay Magistrate’s Court soon,” said Mhlongo.

              <h2>Nongoma woman sentenced to life imprisonment for murder of her boyfriend</h2> <br>
                <h3>Two convicted murderers sentenced in Pietermaritzburg High Court</h3>
              <p>The National Prosecuting Authority welcomed the sentencing of two convicted murderers from the Nongoma area.

                The Pietermaritzburg High Court last week sentenced Nonjabulo Nokukhanya Nkosi (37) and Xolani Skhumbuzo Mtambo (38) to life and 15 years’ imprisonment respectively, following their conviction in the 2021 murder of Dumisani Qwabe (47).
                
                
                NPA regional spokesperson Natasha Ramkisson-Kara said they commend the work done by the prosecution and SAPS in this matter.
                
                Ramkisson-Kara said Nkosi was sentenced to a further five years imprisonment for theft.
                
                Case details
                
                Nkosi was in a romantic relationship with Qwabe and at some point, decided to kill him. She approached Mtambo to arrange for a hitman, but the plan fell through and Nkosi obtained a firearm and petrol to carry out the murder herself.
                
                “In October 2021, Nkosi met Mtambo at a marketplace, where he loaded the firearm for her and showed her how to use it,” said Ramkisson-Kara.
                
                “Thereafter, Qwabe received a call from Nkosi and left his house. Later that night, his motor vehicle was found engulfed in flames on the road between Nongoma and Pongola, with his burnt remains inside.”
                
                Ramkisson-Kara further said Nkosi did not report to work the following day owing to first- and second-degree burns she had sustained to her left cheek and left hand.
                
                Following Qwabe’s death, his family members discovered that his cellphone and bank card were still active, with police investigations revealing Nkosi was using the deceased’s card and banking app to make cash withdrawals and pay for purchases.
                
                She was subsequently arrested and an analysis of her cellphone records led to Mtambo’s arrest three months later.
                
                Court proceedings
                
                “In court, the State, represented by advocates Alex Moolman and Nokulunga Ngcobo, led the evidence of the police officers who attended the scene, as well as cellphone evidence confirming the communication between the accused, their location, and also the communication between Nkosi and Qwabe,” said Ramkisson-Kara.
                
                “The State also handed in evidence of WhatsApp messages between the accused before and after Qwabe’s murder. Footage from CCTV cameras at the ATM where Nkosi used Qwabe’s bank card was also submitted as evidence.
                
                “In aggravation of the sentence, the State handed in Victim Impact Statements compiled by Qwabe’s family members and facilitated by court preparation officers Bhekithemba Hopewell Sithole and Mbalenhle Valencia Komane.
                
                “The statements described Qwabe as a kind and supportive person who had a vested interest in the community. The family said they had difficulty coming to terms with his death, especially since he was killed in such a gruesome manner,” added Ramkisson-Kara.
                
                She said Mtambo was sentenced to 15 years’ imprisonment for murder. In sentencing him, the court considered the fact that he was a first offender and that he was not present on the scene when the offence was committed as substantial and compelling reasons to deviate from the minimum sentence of life imprisonment. Both accused were declared unfit to possess a firearm.

                <h2>Mixed bag for May fuel outlook</h2>

                <h3>It is a mixed fuel price outlook for May with diesel set to decrease while petrol will likely increase
                 <br> 13 hours ago   1 minute read</h3>
                <p>It is both good and bad news for motorists next month as the petrol price is set for yet another hike, while diesel should likely decrease.

                  The Automobile Association (AA) predicts a 37 cents per litre increase in the price of unleaded 93 petrol in May, pushing the price close to R25.15 per litre.

                  The association, which was commenting on unaudited data from the Central Energy Fund (CEF), said unleaded 95 inland would likely increase by 38 cents per litre.
                  
                  “This will push the price of this fuel to around R25.50 cents per litre, higher than the R25.42 seen in August 2022, but not quite the record price of R26.74 in July of the same year.”
                  
                  There could, however, be good news for diesel users as it is set to decrease by 35 cents per litre, while illuminating paraffin is set to come down by 28 cents per litre.
                  
                  “The decrease to diesel prices is especially welcome as it will not result in higher input costs across various sectors, and this won’t be a driving factor in consumer prices increasing,” the AA states.

                  They have expressed concern that South African fuel prices have reached record-high increases over the last three years despite the government not increasing the General Fuel Levy or Road Accident Fund (RAF) levy.
                  
                  “The expected increases reaffirm [the AA’s] belief that a review of the fuel price structure is necessary to establish if any components within the current pricing model can be revised by the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy (DMRE) to mitigate against rising costs,” the AA says.

                  <h2>Maimane claims ANC is fostering Bantu education</h2>
                  <h3> 3 min read</h3>
                  <p>Build One South Africa (Bosa) president, Mmusi Maimane, has demanded the scrapping of the General Education and Training Certificate (GETC), slamming it as “Bantu Education Certificate” during his visit at a community hall in Pimville, Soweto, on Tuesday.

                    GETC was formed by the Department of Basic Education, allowing Grade 9 learners to exit school and enter the working world. The certificate provides alternative options to enter the job market, with skills and recognised certification; and pursue skill-related jobs, instead of the matric and university route.
                    
                    GETC will be recognised as level one under the National Qualifications Framework (NQF). “Business Tech” reported that the certificate was piloted in 2022 across 270 schools in all provinces, and extended to over 1000 schools last year.
                    
                    Maimane blamed the ANC for an archaic education system, saying that “Bantu Education Certificate” is encouraging the ideologies of Hendrick Verwoerd, where black people should not be educated, but remain in low-skilled careers.
                    
                    “Today, the ANC government is in effect determined to mirror this policy through its ‘Bantu Education Certificate’. It limits young, mainly black South Africans to either low-skilled jobs, or unemployment,” said Maimane.
                    
                    He further added that the ruling party is set on disempowering black youths with the use of GETC, and the “Bantu Education Certificate is a sinister attempt by the ANC government to erase the school drop-out problem by issuing a new certificate at Grade 9. It must be stopped immediately,” Maimane said.
                    
                    Under the national governance of Bosa, Maimane pledged providing an improved, competitive and quality education system that will equip young people with skills to compete globally, and contribute to the economy and social needs of South Africa.
                    Maimane stated, Bosa policies will abandon the 30% pass rate: “Learners must excel in their education, especially for maths and science subjects; and extend programmes for under-performing learners to enforce learners to be competitive in the job market and entrepreneurship.
                    
                    “We face a critical shortage of skills, and our performance human skills development is underwhelming. Going to TVETs without a full grasp of the subject matter will not help young people obtain technical qualifications and skills the economy requires,” Maimane said.
                    
                    The World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index ranked South Africa as 101/141 on skills of the current workforce, 107/141 on skills of the future workers, and 119/141 on the quality of vocational training.
                    
                    Bosa will create an independent education ombudsman, conceptualise on strengthening security in schools; prioritise budget for digital learning and infrastructure and establish higher salary for performing teachers.
                    
                    Among other policies, Bosa will form a school grant worth R15000 annually, based on the current cost to educate a child, to assist parents to fund their children’s education in nearby schools, or reinvest the money for private schooling.
                    
                    Maimane stressed that the ANC failed to fix a disparaged education system, by addressing poor school infrastructure, textbook shortages, pit toilets and a weak curriculum. Instead, “these (Bosa) interventions, grounded in accountability, transparency and excellence; are crucial steps forward to rescuing our education system. It is only when we create an environment, where every South African child has equitable access to quality education, that we pave the way for a prosperous and thriving nation”.
