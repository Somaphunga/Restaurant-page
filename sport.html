        <h2>Mikel Arteta wants Arsenal to use ‘painful’ Bayern loss to fuel EPL title bid
          <br>
           3 min read <h2> <br>
            <h3>
              Mikel Arteta has urged Arsenal to use the "pain" of the Champions League quarter-final exit against Bayern Munich to fuel their Premier League title bid.</h3>
          <p >
            Arteta's side failed to clinch a first semi-final appearance since 2009 as Joshua Kimmich's second half header gave Bayern a 1-0 second leg win and a 3-2 aggregate success.


            It was a bitter evening in Munich for Arteta and his players, who had dreamed of leading Arsenal to their maiden Champions League crown.
            
            After a blistering run carried them to the top of the Premier League and into the Champions League last eight, Arsenal have endured a nightmare week.
            
            Below their best
            They were below their best in the 2-2 first leg draw with Bayern, then surrendered pole position in the Premier League after conceding two late goals in a 2-0 home defeat against Aston Villa on Sunday.
            
            After producing another underwhelming display in Germany, Arteta has to find a way to lift his team's shattered morale in time for a last push for the English title.
            
            
            
            "We were very close, that is the reality. It's painful, but we have to learn from this. We had our moments, especially in the first half," Arteta said.
            
            "The players gave their best, we didn't have that magical moment that we need in the competition.
            
            "In the first leg, we conceded two avoidable goals, which had a significant impact on the draw.
            
            "We were still alive when we arrived here. The margins are so fine. A mistake or a moment makes the difference.”
            
            After a lengthy absence from the Champions League, Arsenal largely acquitted themselves well.
            
            'Still beautiful’
            They won their group ahead of PSV Eindhoven, Lens and Sevilla before beating Porto on the penalties in the last 16.
            But Arteta conceded a lack of experience in the latter stages of the competition proved a key factor against Bayern, six-time European champions who are perennial contenders for the trophy.
            
            "We haven't been in this position for 14 years, we haven't played in the Champions League for seven years. There's a reason for that. Today's match will make us better," he said.
            
            "I think we have the capacity and the quality to be in the semi-final. When you look historically, it took other clubs seven, eight or 10 years to do it in the Champions League.
            
            "It's easy to praise the players and talk nice things when we win 10 in a row and one draw (in the Premier League).
            
            "The moment is now to be behind them and be next to them.”
            
            Arsenal have little time to lick their wounds, with the title race approaching a gripping conclusion.
            
            Arteta's side are in second place, two points behind leaders Manchester City.
            
            Everything still to play for
            Third-placed Liverpool trail Arsenal on goal difference, with all three clubs having six games left.
            
            With City playing Chelsea in the FA Cup semi-finals this weekend, the Gunners have a chance to return to first place if they win at Wolves on Saturday.
            
            Arteta has told his tired troops to embrace the opportunity to chase Arsenal's first Premier League crown for 20 years.
            
            "What we have to play for (in the Premier League) is still beautiful. We have six games to go and we are two points behind City," he said.
            
            "It's a very difficult schedule for everybody. We have to go through the pain tonight, and tomorrow get up and come with the same attitude that we came with here.
            
            "I can guarantee you by tomorrow we're fully focused on Wolves and everybody is lifted."

              Liverpool abandon Sporting CP pursuit in favour of better option to kickstart new era
              <br>
              2 min read 
              </h2>
            <p>
              
Liverpool have reportedly turned their attention from one Sporting CP man to another, as they would now prefer the signing of centre-back Ousmane Diomande.

A new era is coming at Liverpool, with some big changes on the way. The biggest one is no doubt the departure of nine-year veteran boss Jurgen Klopp, and the subsequent replacement of the German.

Right now, it looks most likely that Ruben Amorim will take the job, with talks over the signing of the Sporting manager – who has his side seven points clear at Liga Portugal’s summit – having moved to the next stage.

He’d be working closely with the new sporting director, Richard Hughes, as Jorg Schmadtke is also vacating that position at Anfield.

That Amorim looks likely to take the managerial role has paved the way for a lot of reports regarding the signings of some of his Sporting disciples.

A new centre-back signing has long looked like one of the main aims of whoever takes over from Klopp, and Sporting man Goncalo Inacio has headed that list for a while.

It’s believed Amorim has requested his signing alongside that of his current winger Marcus Edwards, and Bayer Leverkusen man Alex Grimaldo.

However, after reports that Inacio will be cheaper than first expected – now £40million – it seems Liverpool’s attention has turned to his centre-back partner, Diomande.

Liverpool prefer Diomande to Inacio
Indeed, according to Football Transfers, the Reds are now ‘monitoring the situation’ of the defender.

They see a centre-back as crucial to their rebuild after Klopp has left the club, and seemingly now prefer the Ivorian to his teammate.
His ‘commanding presence’ is seen as an attractive asset for a lot of sides.

It’s why Chelsea and Newcastle are both keeping a keen eye on Diomande, as well as Liverpool.

Diomande to cost £68.5million
According to Football Transfers, Sporting are ‘likely to demand’ the full £68.5million exit clause for the player.

It’s said Inacio – who’s likely to be sold as well – will also command his full clause, contrary to recent reports.

That means he’s still going to cost £51million, which is over £10million more than was suggested of late.


Given a big sum will have to be paid for either player, Liverpool may not be too bothered about the gap, knowing that while Diomande will cost a bit more, he could be a higher-quality asset for them in the long run.

              <h2>Bundesliga: TV rights auction suspended after DAZN complaint<br>
                 3 min read</h2> 
                
              <p>
                t's been an historic week for German football on the pitch as Bayer Leverkusen won the Bundesliga for the first time and both Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich progressed to the semifinals of the Champions League.

But it's also a big week off the pitch as the German Football League (DFL), which operates the Bundesliga, opens the bidding for the sale of its domestic broadcast rights for the seasons 2025/26 to 2028/29.


The billion-euro negotiations take place every four years and are a vital process since they concern German football clubs' most important revenue stream.

However, the DFL confirmed on Wednesday evening that it had taken the unprecedented step of suspending the auction after just three days following a legal complaint from one of the bidders, current rights holder DAZN.

What exactly has DAZN complained about?
According to German media reports, the online streaming service has complained of unfair treatment by the DFL, accusing the league of "abusing its dominant position in the football broadcast rights market" and "contravening German and European competition law."

In a letter to the DFL seen by the mass daily BILD and the regional Frankfurter Rundschau newspaper, DAZN expressed "deep disappointment and great dismay that our offer was rejected, even though [we] had made the most financially attractive and most convincing offer for rights package B."

"We are led to believe that our financial offer lay substantially above every other offer."

Rights package B is the largest package on sale, according the winning bidder the rights to exclusively broadcast 196 live games per season, including the five 3:30 p.m. kickoffs every Saturday, the weekly Friday night fixtures and the end-of-season relegation/promotion play-offs.
DAZN, which in the current broadcast deal has the rights to the Friday and Sunday fixtures, making it the DFL's second-biggest broadcast partner, says it had bid for the package against pay TV broadcaster Sky, the premier partner which currently holds the rights to all Saturday matches.

Claiming to have lost out due to a failure to produce a last-minute bank guarantee rather than a private letter of responsibility which it said had sufficed in previous auctions, DAZN complained: "We have no other explanation for this behavior other than that the DFL management had already anticipated awarding package B to its preferred bidder."


DFL rebukes 'incorrect and unfounded' accusations
The DFL confirmed the reports to the German SID sports news agency on Wednesday night but strongly rejected the accusations.

"The insinuations and accusations raised are incorrect and unfounded and we reject them in the strongest possible terms," it said in a statement, claiming that the DAZN letter of complaint contains "numerous incorrect portrayals and misrepresentation of facts."

The DFL said it would discuss the issue with Germany's Federal Competition Regulator, the Bundeskartellamt, which has already been alerted by DAZN.

It insisted that it is conducting the auction process in adherence to all relevant rules and regulations and "in a transparent and non-discriminatory manner," but that chief executives Marc Lenz and Steffen Merkel had decided to temporarily halt the auction "in order to protect the legal security of the process."

Bundesliga TV rights: What now?
The legal dispute comes at a highly inopportune time for the DFL, whose current domestic broadcast deals with Sky and DAZN run out at the end of this season in June.

The current deals are worth around €1.1 billion ($1.17 billion), a sum which is divided up among Bundesliga clubs according to a points-based formula.

By way of comparison, the equivalent deal for England's Premier League is worth £1,63 billion (€1.9 billion; $2 billion).

The DFL will be especially keen to increase that figure following the recent collapse of a proposed private equity investment in its international broadcast rights after large-scale fan protests.

But it now faces the prospect of weeks or months of potential legal wrangling.
